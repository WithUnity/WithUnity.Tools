## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find an issue with the tools, please check that the issue has not already been raised on:
https://github.com/WithUnity/WithUnity.Tools/issues
If it has not already been reported please report the issue.

If the issue has already been raised and it has not been prioritised on the project TODO list here: https://github.com/WithUnity/WithUnity.Tools/projects
Please add a comment to increase its priority. If the Issue was moved to the TODO list over 1 month ago add a comment to the Issue on the TODO list

## Update schedule
These tools are provided free of charge and as a hobby of mine. Issues will be fixed when I have time. If you need commercial support then consider making a regular donation to the project. Use the Contact form on WithUnity.org to make a polite suggestion.
When/if  a backlog of issues develops, security fixes will always be prioritised first and then the Issues with the most votes will moved to the top of the lost.

## Commercial use
This Library has been published mainly for my own use in other charitable projects for Christian Charities or Ecological charities.
If you need support on a commercial basis contact withiunity.org and leave a polite suggestion and we will then hire more people to provide commercial support.
Also provide our team with stars so we can add a donate button to the project.
